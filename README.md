# clemo-wordpress

This project is a simply responsive webpage built with common web languages (html5, css3, javascript) and installed in Wordpress. 

Based on [free psd design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/35699887/Clemo-Free-PSD-Template) by Illia Nesterov.

I'm using heroku.com on production.
